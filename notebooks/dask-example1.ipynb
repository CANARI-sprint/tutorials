    "Dask.delayed is a simple and powerful way to parallelize existing code. It allows users to delay function calls into a task graph with dependencies. Dask.delayed doesn’t provide any fancy parallel algorithms like Dask.dataframe, but it does give the user complete control over what they want to build.\n",
