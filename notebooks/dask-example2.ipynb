    "# Custom Workloads with Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has been copied from https://examples.dask.org/futures.html and adapted to work with JASMIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask futures provide fine-grained real-time execution for custom situations. This is the foundation for other APIs like Dask arrays and dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start Dask Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike for arrays and dataframes, you need the Dask client to use the Futures interface. Additionally the client provides a dashboard which is useful to gain insight on the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link to the dashboard will become visible when you create the client below. We recommend having it open on one side of your screen while using your notebook on the other side. This can take some effort to arrange your windows, but seeing them both at the same is very useful when learning."
